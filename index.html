						<h2 class="major">Black Jack</h2>
						<p> This is a simple interactive Black Jack game using Python. It is based on user input into
							the terminal and was
							one of my very first experiences with coding during my software bootcamp program at
							DigitalCrafts in Atlanta.
							I experimented with very basic design by the addition of simple color and emojis within the
							command
							line interface just to
							make it a tad more engaging visually.

						<h2 class="major">Dad Jokes!</h2>
						<p> This was a team effort and my first project where I could stretch my newbie UI legs a bit! We
							built an API based application focused solely on Front-End development.
							It was constructed from the use of two APIs, a joke simulator and an avatar simulator. All
							of us as a team contributed to mulitple tasks, however my primary role was
							was developing the design/visual layout and user features of this app. This was a fun one for sure!</p>

						<p> SoulReads is an online book club built with React and Express. It allows for members to keep
							an online library and book journal, and also allows for member interaction through a public member forum. 
							This was a complete Full-Stack application developed by a team of myself and two other
							amazing women! My primary role was constructing our entire front-end with ReactJS,
							developing everything from the components, to the visual conception/layout,
							and the full visual design. This project was completed in terms of a capstone presentation,
							but will continue to be fully developed and pushed to market.

					<h2 class="major">Stepping stones...</h2>
					<p>My time at DigitalCrafts (Atlanta) was definitely a major stepping stone for me! I learned
						Full-Stack development in the course of 16 intensive weeks! I'm also currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree
						in Software Development and have a Google IT Support certification. My journey in tech started in the Navy! With contininug 
						to grow as a developer I've learned about many different tools and technologies and as a result have become a cloud enthusiast! 
						I have quite the obsession with expanding my skills, so I'm also working to attain certifications in both AWS and the Google Cloud Platform. 
						Needless to say I am passionate about continuous learning! I've was a theatre nerd as a kid and always had a creative flair so no one expected
						me to pursue a tech career, and had never imagined a life in the tech space, but tech is one of the most creative and innovative spaces which 
						impacts our entire lives. To learn and work in a field that allows me to have a direct hand in how we experience our world is a path!

							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							
							<p>I'm based in Virgina Beach, VA and am originally from California (Bay Area). In the Navy I served as
								an SSDS technician, maintaining computer systems which controlled weapons and radars onboard. After the Navy, I went to
								school for film and graphic design, but my love for technology found it's way back to the forefront when I consistently found 
								myself obsessed with new devices/apps and how they work. I wanted to find a way to create visually beautiful products/web apps/devices, but 
								was just as concerned with them working effectively on the back end! In the tech space I get to incorporate all of my skills and interests together which 
								allows for not only purposeful path but an exciting one which is key. Please feel to connect with me as I'd love to expand my network and grow through opportunity!
